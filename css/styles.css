/*
  ADVANCED CSS ITERATION PROJECT (NONPROFIT)

  Your job: modernize the design over time using advanced CSS.
  Most weekly changes happen here.

  Ground rules:
  - Keep CSS organized by section.
  - Demonstrate intentional use of cascade/specificity.
  - Make it responsive.
  - Prioritize accessibility: readable contrast, focus states, usable navigation.

/* Week 1: add base reset + default typography */
/* Week 2: show control of cascade/specificity */
/* Week 10–11: refactor layouts using Flexbox and Grid */
/* Week 14–15: add transitions + keyframe animation (subtle, purposeful) */
